# Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `cse` and a method `mech` to perform the calculation.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. **Get user input**: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class named `cse`.
3. **Define the method**: Inside the class, define the method `mech` to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. **Execute the program**: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

```
class cse:
    def mech(self,radius):
        area=3.1416*radius*radius
        return area
r=cse()
rad=int(input())
data=r.mech(rad)
print(f"Area of circle: {data:.2f}")

```

## Result
       A python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided,is successfully executed, by using class and objects.
